# Transforming a Report into a Dashboard

For this lab assignment, you are tasked with transforming some aspect of the
[2020 Wellcome Global Health Monitor Report ](https://wellcome.org/reports/wellcome-global-monitor/2020) or the 
[2018 Global Health Monitor Report](https://wellcome.org/reports/wellcome-global-monitor/2018) into a 
dashboard. Anything in either of these reports is fair game, so find something
that inspires you!

In case you are drawing a blank, here are some ideas:

- compare data from 2018 and 2020
- compare two aspects of the same issue (e.g., knowledge of science)
- compare two related issues (e.g., knowledge of science and trust in science)

## Dashboard Requirements

The dashboard you create **must** have the following:

- a navigation logo (similar to the Olympic rings)
- icons to your socials (e.g., LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter, email)
- at least two pages
- at least two tabsets (can be on just one page)
- at least two cards with quick information (e.g., % of people across the world
who have faith in vaccines)
- at least on plot made with `leaflet`
- a non-default theme
- non-default plot colors (must coordinate with theme)

## Submission

You are required to submit **both** the link to your GitHub repository 
containing your source code **and** a link to your [published]{.underline}
dashboard. You are expected to publish your dashboard through
[Quarto Pub](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/quarto-pub.html), a free
publishing service for static content created with Quarto.
